## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-20

Adds support for **Needle v2** (`Cactus-Compute/needle2`). Upstream replaced the
v1 encoder-decoder SAN with a decoder-only architecture in a new container; the
two share no weights, loader, or quantisation scheme, so v2 lands alongside v1
rather than replacing it. Both are supported.

Rationale, measurements and the optimisations that were rejected are in
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md); the port's engineering record, including what
changed upstream, is in [docs/v2-port-record.md](docs/v2-port-record.md).

### Added

**Needle v2 runtime**

- `needle-core::v2` — decoder-only forward pass: mHC lane routing with Sinkhorn
  mixing, Engram n-gram memory, HadamardMLP, GQA attention with q/k ZCRMSNorm and
  a sigmoid output gate, sliding-window KV cache, tied LM head.
- `needle-core::cq` — Cactus-Quants weights (2/3/4-bit and ternary, Hadamard-rotated
  Lloyd-Max codebooks). The rotation is applied to the activation rather than the
  weights, so weights are never reconstructed during inference.
- `needle-core::hadamard` — fast Walsh-Hadamard transform, replacing both dense
  Hadamard matmuls.
- `needle-core::v2::batch` — batched, chunked prefill.
- `needle-core::v2::heads` — contrastive and confidence probe heads, pooled with a
  streaming softmax in `O(probes x d_model)` instead of retaining every cell.
- `confidence_for(query, tools, completion)` on all four surfaces (Rust, C ABI,
  WASM, Python). The confidence head scores a completed judgement, so it needs
  the prompt plus the model's own output; passing a bare query to the raw
  `confidence` primitive reads near zero however answerable the query is.
- `needle-infer::cact` — `.cact` container reader. The tensor directory is
  nameless, so the canon is derived from the header geometry and every slot's
  shape validated against it.
- `needle-infer::sp_tokenizer` — SentencePiece BPE decoded from the container's
  embedded piece table. No vocabulary file.
- `needle-infer::v2_engine` — prompt template, greedy and temperature sampling,
  streaming, grammar-constrained decoding, `<tool_call>` / `<think>` extraction.
- Bindings: `needle_v2_*` (C ABI), `NeedleV2Wasm` (WASM), `needle_rs.V2Engine`
  (Python).
- `needle-rs` CLI dispatches on the model file; `--constrain`, `--max-tokens`,
  `--temperature`, `--seed`, `--system`, `--json`, `--prefill-chunk`.

**Other**

- `parallel` feature (rayon) — splits large matvec/matmul row ranges and the
  batched-prefill per-position loops. Enabled for the CLI, C ABI and Python wheel;
  off for WASM and `no_std`. Row splitting leaves each row's arithmetic untouched,
  so results are bit-identical.
- AVX2 runtime dispatch for the packed dot product, selected by CPUID.
- Crate metadata for publishing: keywords, categories, `rust-version = "1.87"`.

### Changed

- **The CLI crate publishes as `needle-rs-cli`**, not `needle-cli`: that name on
  crates.io belongs to an unrelated project, as does `needle-rs`. The installed
  binary is unchanged (`needle-rs`), and `cargo install needle-rs-cli` is the
  install line. `cargo install needle-cli` fetches someone else's tool.
- `needle-wasm` and `needle-python` set `publish = false`. They are distributed
  as the npm and PyPI packages named `needle-rs`; neither was ever a crates.io
  artifact, and this makes that explicit rather than incidental.
- The release workflow now fails before uploading anything if the git tag does
  not match `Cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml`. npm took its version from the tag
  while crates.io and PyPI took theirs from the manifests, so a tag that outran
  a version bump would have published three different versions, none of them
  retractable.
- The npm package ships a README written for it, with absolute links, plus the
  licence. Previously `files` omitted the README entirely, so the npmjs.com page
  would have rendered from the description alone; wasm-pack's copy of the
  workspace README also carries repo-relative image links that 404 off GitHub.
- KV cache is a ring sized to the attention window rather than `max_seq_len`:
  **14.2 MB instead of 113.3 MB**. `V2Model::make_state_full_causal` allocates the
  full length for the probe heads, which attend over the whole sequence.
- Packed dot product accumulates in 8 independent lanes rather than one running
  scalar, which was latency-bound: **2.9x** on the 2-bit projections, **2.8x** on
  the tied LM head.
- Prefill **5.74 -> 1.60 ms/token** through batching, threading, batched Engram
  projections, and threading the per-position loops.
- `needle-python` uses pyo3 0.29 with `abi3-py38`: one wheel for every CPython
  >= 3.8.

### Fixed

- `needle-python` could not build against any Python newer than 3.12, so
  `cargo build --workspace` failed outright on a current system.
- An aarch64-only `unreachable_statement` warning failed `-D warnings` on exactly
  the ARM targets this crate targets.
- Nothing verified the NEON INT4 kernel against the scalar reference; added a
  differential test.
- The v1 fixture generators broke silently when upstream restructured; each now
  pins the v1 reference commit (`1807b1d`).
- Constrained decoding could repeat an argument key while another declared key was
  still unused (`with_unique_arg_keys`, v2 only, so v1 token parity is unchanged).
- `needle-infer` no longer ships a 511 KB parity fixture no consumer can use.

### Verified

Against `Cactus-Compute/needle2` (13,737,807 bytes, 405 tensors):

- **Forward pass** — 788 capture points across 27 layers match upstream's
  `decode.forward_cached` on the same weights; largest relative deviation 1.9e-5.
- **End to end** — exact generated token ids over 14 prompt/tool combinations
  (2,482 tokens, longest prompt 364, past the 256-token window).
- **Container** — header, directory and codebook match `export.read_export()`
  field for field; all 145 CQ and 259 FP16 tensors match; the canon covers all 405
  exactly once.
- **Tokenizer** — exact token-ID match on 44 cases against both upstream's
  `RefTokenizer` and real `sentencepiece`.
- **Probe heads** — contrastive within 1.4e-6, confidence within 7.2e-5.
- **Batched prefill** — bit-identical to the sequential path across prompt lengths
  1..129 x chunk sizes 1/8/32/128.

Two optimisations were measured and rejected: hand-written NEON for the packed dot
product was *slower* than LLVM's autovectorisation of the same loop (7.1 against
8.1 Gelem/s), and threading decode's small matvecs made decode **3.5x slower**
(135 to 476 ms). Two write-ordering bugs introduced by the KV ring — batched
write-ahead clobbering entries earlier positions still needed, in attention and in
the Engram value ring — were caught by the end-to-end suite before release.

### Docs and examples

- Every example runs on **both** model versions: the browser demo has a model
  picker and adapts its controls to what the loaded version supports, the CLI
  quickstart takes `--v1` / `--v2` / `--both`, the C-ABI example infers the
  version from the file extension, and the DOM editor accepts `?model=v1`.
- `crates/needle-wasm/tests/node_e2e_v2.js` asserts the contract the browser
  demo depends on, across both versions, and runs in CI.
- README rewritten around v2 with v1 documented alongside; `assets/banner.svg`
  and a new `assets/terminal.svg` carry measured numbers.

### Fixed — docs and examples

- `V2Engine::build_prompt` now compacts the tools JSON. The model was trained on
  compact schemas, and the indentation `JSON.stringify(x, null, 2)` produces was
  enough to change the answer: the same query and schema yielded a correct call
  compact and `[]` pretty-printed. Already-compact input is byte-identical, so
  parity is unmoved.
- The C-ABI example freed a pointer ctypes had already converted to a Python
  `bytes`, aborting the process. String returns are now declared `c_void_p`.
- The DOM editor's `tsconfig.json` was missing `"strict": true`, so TypeScript
  did not narrow discriminated unions and `npm run build` failed on correct code.
- The browser demo now settles on the returned text when streaming ends: v1
  strips the `<tool_call>` marker and restores the caller's tool-name casing, so
  the streamed tokens are a progress view rather than the answer.

### Known limitations

- Prefill is slower than the fused dense-f32 reference (1.60 against 0.51
  ms/token). This is the cost of running from 13.7 MB of 2-bit weights rather than
  ~180 MB dequantised, not an implementation gap.
- A tool call can repeat an argument key once every declared key has been used;
  forcing the object closed needs the grammar extended to the value boundary.
- The probe heads need the full-length cache (113 MB). `new_head_state` plus
  `encode_contrastive_with_state` reuses one across calls; `retrieve_tools` does.
- AVX2 correctness is asserted on CI's x86_64 runners; no throughput figure is
  claimed, as development is on aarch64.
- The v2 MTP head is not ported: `export.py` writes no MTP tensors, so the
  container carries none.
- Confidence is the calibration head only. Upstream's published score is the
  minimum of that head and the decode probability of the call tokens; the
  composition lives in Cactus's compiled engine, so there is no reference to
  verify a port against. `confidence_for` exposes the head with the
  prompt-plus-completion input it was trained on.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-17

Initial public release.

### Added

  GQA attention, gated residuals, FFN (SwiGLU/DReLU/GeGLU), tied-embedding LM head
- `needle-infer`: inference engine with SafeTensors loader, BPE tokenizer,
  constrained decoder (JSON Schema + flat format), contrastive retrieval head

  `needle_run_stream`, `needle_encode_contrastive`, `needle_contrastive_dim`,
  `needle_retrieve_tools`, `needle_free`, `needle_free_str`, `needle_last_error`)
- `needle-wasm`: WASM bindings via wasm-bindgen (`load`, `run`, `run_stream`,
  `run_batch`, `encode_contrastive`, `retrieve_tools`)
- `needle-cli`: CLI binary with `--stream` flag for per-token output
- AVX2 runtime dispatch (CPUID, no `target-cpu=native`) and NEON (aarch64 baseline)
- 91 tests: 47 Rust unit/integration + 44 Node.js WASM assertions
- E2E parity suite: exact token-ID match against Python/JAX reference (10 examples)
- Constrained decoder handles both flat and JSON Schema tool definitions;
  fixes a latent bug in the Python reference for OpenAI-compatible tool formats

### Performance (Intel i7-1185G7)
