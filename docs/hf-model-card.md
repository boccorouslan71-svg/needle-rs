# HuggingFace Model Card

**Filename:** `README.md` in the `Abdalrahman/needle-rs-safetensors` HuggingFace repository.

## Upload checklist

1. **Upload `banner.svg` first** (from `assets/banner.svg` in this repo) — commit it to the HF
   repo before the README. If you commit the README first, the image will 404 on first render
   and HF's CDN cache may stick on the broken state for hours.
2. Verify `Cactus-Compute/needle` matches Cactus's actual HF org slug exactly
   (`https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute/needle` — checked, returns 200 as of 2026-08-20).
   If they ever rename or move the repo, update `base_model:` below before publishing.
   **These weights convert Needle v1.** Upstream has since released v2 at
   `Cactus-Compute/needle2`, a different architecture in a different container
   (see `docs/v2-port-record.md`). Both repos resolve; keep `base_model:` on
   `needle` so the card is not mistaken for a v2 conversion.
   Note that **v2 needs no conversion repo at all** — needle-rs reads upstream's
   own `.cact` container directly, so there is nothing to host and nothing to
   keep in sync. This repository exists only because v1 shipped as a Flax
   checkpoint. Say so on the card rather than letting readers assume a v2
   equivalent is missing.
3. `inference: false` is correct — there is no HF Inference-compatible adapter.
4. `library_name: needle-rs` is not a registered HF library; HF will display it as-is.
   That is fine — it links users to the runtime.

## Paste below into HF README.md (everything from the `---` onward, verbatim)

The YAML front-matter must be at the very top of the file with no blank line before it.

# needle-rs-safetensors

**INT4-packed SafeTensors weights for [Needle](https://github.com/cactus-compute/needle), ready to load into the [needle-rs](https://github.com/Geekgineer/needle-rs) pure-Rust + WebAssembly runtime.**

> **This is a format conversion.** The model itself — its architecture, training procedure, dataset, and original weights — is the work of [**Cactus Compute**](https://github.com/cactus-compute) (Henry Ndubuaku et al., 2026), released under MIT. Original repository: [`Cactus-Compute/needle`](https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute/needle).
>
> If you build with these weights, you are building on Cactus's Needle. Please credit them in any publication, blog post, product, or downstream model that incorporates this work. Citation template below.

> **Which Needle is this?** Needle **v1** — the encoder-decoder SAN. Upstream's current release is **v2** ([`Cactus-Compute/needle2`](https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute/needle2)), a decoder-only architecture with mHC lanes, Engram memory, HadamardMLP blocks, and Cactus-Quants weights in a `.cact` container. v2 shares no weight tensors with v1, so these files are not interchangeable with it.
>
> **If you want v2, you do not need this repository.** needle-rs 0.2.0 runs v2 from upstream's own container, verified token-exact against the JAX reference — download `needle2.cact` straight from [`Cactus-Compute/needle2`](https://huggingface.co/Cactus-Compute/needle2). These converted files exist because v1 shipped as a Flax checkpoint that no Rust runtime could read; v2 needed no such conversion. The same binary loads either.

For full architectural details, training procedure, and benchmarks, see the [upstream Needle repository](https://github.com/cactus-compute/needle).

## Weight format

The SafeTensors file uses a custom `I4` dtype for quantized kernels:

- **Group-wise INT4** with `group_size=32`, per-group scale = `max|w| / 7`, packed as nibbles (low nibble = even row, high nibble = odd row, per output column).
- **Non-kernel parameters** (RMSNorm γ, gate vectors, embeddings) stored in BF16.
- **Model config** (d_model, num_heads, max_seq_len, etc.) embedded in the SafeTensors `__metadata__` JSON, so no separate config file is needed.

This format is consumed directly by `needle-rs`. It is not compatible with `transformers`, `safetensors-rust` direct loading without the `needle-rs` engine, or other generic SafeTensors consumers, because the `I4` dtype is non-standard.

## How to use

The intended runtime is [`needle-rs`](https://github.com/geekgineer/needle-rs). The same weights work across all its deployment targets — native CLI, Rust API, C FFI, and browser/Node.js via WebAssembly.

### Download weights

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

weights_path = hf_hub_download("Abdalrahman/needle-rs-safetensors", "needle.safetensors")
vocab_path   = hf_hub_download("Abdalrahman/needle-rs-safetensors", "vocab.txt")
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
huggingface-cli download Abdalrahman/needle-rs-safetensors \
  needle.safetensors vocab.txt --local-dir weights/
```

### Command line

```bash

# Single inference
./needle-rs weights/needle.safetensors weights/vocab.txt \
  "What's the weather in Paris?" \
  '[{"name":"get_weather","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"location":{"type":"string"}}}}]'
# → {"name":"get_weather","arguments":{"location":"Paris"}}
```

### Rust

```rust
use needle_infer::NeedleEngine;

let engine = NeedleEngine::load(
    "weights/needle.safetensors",
    "weights/vocab.txt",
)?;
let result = engine.run(query, tools_json);
println!("{}", result.text);
```

### Browser (WebAssembly)

```js
import init, { NeedleWasm } from "needle-rs";

await init();

const HF = "https://huggingface.co/Abdalrahman/needle-rs-safetensors/resolve/main";

const [weights, vocab] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(`${HF}/needle.safetensors`).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()).then(b => new Uint8Array(b)),
  fetch(`${HF}/vocab.txt`).then(r => r.text()),
]);

const engine = NeedleWasm.load(weights, vocab);
const result = engine.run("Book a flight from London to JFK tomorrow", toolsJson);
// → {"name":"book_flight","arguments":{"origin":"London","destination":"JFK","date":"tomorrow"}}
```

**Live demo:** [needle-rs.pages.dev](https://needle-rs.pages.dev) — the demo loads exactly these files from this repository.

### Python

```bash
pip install needle-rs
```

```python
from needle_rs import NeedleEngine

engine = NeedleEngine.load("weights/needle.safetensors", "weights/vocab.txt")

# Single call
result = engine.run(
    "Book a flight from London to JFK tomorrow",
    '[{"name":"book_flight","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"origin":{"type":"string"},"destination":{"type":"string"},"date":{"type":"string"}}}}]',
)
# → [{"name":"book_flight","arguments":{"origin":"London","destination":"JFK","date":"tomorrow"}}]

# Streaming (callback fires per token)
result = engine.run_stream(query, tools_json, lambda token_id, piece: print(piece, end="", flush=True))

# Batch
results = engine.run_batch([("query1", tools1), ("query2", tools2)])

# Semantic tool retrieval (requires weights with a contrastive head)
ranked = engine.retrieve_tools(
    "What's the weather in Paris?",
    ["Get current weather for a location", "Book a flight", "Send an email"],
    top_k=2,
)
# → [(0, 0.91), (1, 0.38)]
```

### Multi-tool routing example

Needle is trained to pick the right tool from a list, not just fill a single tool's parameters:

```bash
./needle-rs weights/needle.safetensors weights/vocab.txt \
  "Turn off the bedroom lights" \
  '[
    {"name":"get_weather","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"location":{"type":"string"}}}},
    {"name":"play_music","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"song":{"type":"string"}}}},
    {"name":"control_lights","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"room":{"type":"string"},"state":{"type":"string"}}}},
    {"name":"send_message","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"recipient":{"type":"string"},"body":{"type":"string"}}}}
  ]'
# → {"name":"control_lights","arguments":{"room":"bedroom","state":"off"}}
```

## Intended use

- **Client-side intent routing in web applications** — decide which API endpoint to call before issuing the network request, with no server-side LLM.
- **Edge function dispatch** — Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno Deploy, anywhere with a WASM engine and ≤30 MB of available memory.
- **On-device function calling** in privacy-sensitive contexts (healthcare, legal, personal data) where sending user queries to a hosted LLM is unacceptable.
- **Embedded agents** on hardware with enough RAM for the weights (≈30 MB working set including activations).
- **Tool retrieval** — the optional contrastive head exposed by `needle-rs.encode_contrastive()` can semantically rank a tool catalogue before passing the top-K to the generator.

## Limitations

- **Tool calling only.** Needle is trained for the single task of mapping a query plus tool definitions to a JSON call. It is not a chat model and will not produce meaningful free-form text.
- **Single-shot.** No multi-turn dialogue, no chain-of-thought, no tool-use feedback loop. Each call is independent.
- **English-trained.** Multilingual behavior is not evaluated by upstream and is not guaranteed.
- **Greedy decoding only** for v1 in `needle-rs` — stochasticity is undesirable for routing, and v1 exposes no sampling path. (The runtime's v2 engine does support temperature, seeding and schema-constrained decoding; that applies to `.cact` weights, not to these files.)
- **Encoder length ≤ 1,024 tokens.** Long tool catalogues must be pre-filtered via contrastive retrieval before being passed in.
- **Small-model failure modes apply.** Ambiguous queries, tools with overlapping descriptions, or unusual parameter schemas can produce unexpected routings. The constrained decoder guarantees syntactic validity, not semantic correctness.

## Out of scope

- General-purpose text generation, summarization, translation, or chat.
- Long-context reasoning (>1,024 tokens of input).
- Reasoning over tool outputs (the model produces calls, not results — your application executes the call and decides what to do with the response).
- Production use in safety-critical domains without an evaluation suite covering the specific tool catalogue and query distribution.

## Citation

If you publish or distribute work that uses these weights, please cite **the upstream Needle model**. These files convert v1, so v1 is the entry to use:

```bibtex
@misc{ndubuaku2026needle,
  title  = {Needle: A 26M-Parameter Tool-Calling Transformer},
  author = {Ndubuaku, Henry and Mroz, Jakub and Mosoyan, Karen and Shemet, Roman

  year   = {2026},
  url    = {https://github.com/cactus-compute/needle}
}
```

If your work uses Needle **v2** instead, cite the entry Cactus asks for, reproduced verbatim from their README. The design and ablations are in [arXiv:2607.18363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.18363):

```bibtex

  year         = {2026},
  organization = {Cactus Compute, Inc.},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/cactus-compute/needle}}
}
```

Optionally, cite the runtime if relevant to your work:
